    <h3>The Aim of the project</h3>
    <p>
        This is the longest Project I have worked on and likely the most code heavy system I hame created.
        When I started the project Awack I did not have such a large vision for the bot originally it
        was just going to reply with funny things and maybe sheare invites to servers I was in.
        This was untill I realised how large the Python Library "Discord.py" actually was and
        what you can automate with it.

    <h3>The Implimentation</h3>
    <p>
        Curently the Awack Bot has over 30 commands and will only grow as I work on it more.
        When i first started to learn the "Discord.py" Library I found it hard as working with
        Asynchronous functions was completly new to me. Although the Learning curve was large I 
        quickly got the handle of it and started to come up with lots of new ideas on what I could
        add to the bot. Curently the system Can not only interat with discord but also Post on its 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/AwackTeam">Twitter</a>
        and pull Gifs from <a href="https://giphy.com/">Giphy.com</a> but also play games
        and other cool things.

    <h3>How its turned out</h3>
    <p>
        This project isnt completed yet and isnt running unless I host it locally which I only do at the moment
        to add new features or fix bugs but hopfully in the future I will publish the bot to the public.
        Id like to make some more commands dealing with the Twitter API but for now I think the Bot has been a huge
        success and am very proud of the code aswell as the Bots functionality in servers.
