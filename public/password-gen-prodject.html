    <h3>The Aim of the project</h3>
    <p>
        Started this project to create strong, <a href="https://github.com/zzixM/zzixMs-account-tool">randomly Generated passwords,</a> 
        for users who didn't want to use other softwear to store and Generate passwords.
        I also wanted the softwear to be as user friendly as posseble while still
        keeping its main aim of functionality. This project took allot of time originally
        as I had not planed the project befor I started to code it which is a lesson i have
        since learned from.

    <h3>The Implimentation</h3>
    <p>
        At first I was only going to program the password Generator function of the program
        but after that was complete I realised I wanted to add some extra utility to the program
        to test my skills. Curently the program can Generate, save and display passwords
        and randomised string usernames. The main feature id like to add to the program is
        a encrypt and decrypt function that allows the Generated passwords to not be stored
        in plain text which is not secure. The program allows the user to generate passwords 
        between the lengths of 4 and 24 and up to 20 at a time.

    <h3>How its turned out</h3>
    <p>
        The project, In my opinion, is a success and fulfills the goal I had.
        This project was the first real piece of softwear I made to fulfill a 
        purpose and i belive that the program is efficent and user friendly.
        If youd like to download the softwear you can find it on my Github account
